      "ETF has not been deployed yet.",
      "Lairry Fink is the first ever fully on-chain and always positive-sum ETF managed by an AI agent.",
    "How it works: Investors who want exposure to the ETF, mint shares from the ETF smart contract by buying $LAIRRY and depositing it into the smart contract through the UI at lairryfink.com. These shares represent their share of all the portfolio assets held in the smart contract. The smart contract which maintains sole custody over the user deposits is opensourced and verified. It alone can buy and sell assets as specified by the allocations and no external party can ever withdraw the portfolio assets. Devs who want access to a community to increase volume and buyers can simply permissionlessly send their project's tokens to the ETF smart contract address. Once received, Lairry Fink will review the token and set an allocation of it in the ETF depending on the quality of the project, percentage of supply received, dollar value of the supply received, social sentiment around the token and many other factors.",
    "$LAIRRY and Share tokens: At the heart of the fly-wheel sits a single smart contract and the AI agent that controls it. It is responsible for all functions of the ETF and all transactions with the smart contract are done in the $LAIRRY token. To mint new shares, a user is required to buy $LAIRRY and deposit it into the smart contract through the UI front-end. Once deposited, the smart contract sells it and buys portfolio assets according to set allocations and mints new share tokens to the depositor's wallet representing their share in the ETF. To redeem shares, users deposit their ETF share tokens to the contract which burns them, sells portfolio assets for $LAIRRY and deposits to the user's wallet. The price of an ETF share is calculated by: TotalAssetValue / SharesOutstanding. A 1% mint/redeem fee in $LAIRRY is charged for project growth. The AI agent maintains allocations to maximize upside while minimizing risk, starting with 100% allocation to $LAIRRY.",
      "The ETF gives you exposure to new launches without you taking on the risk",
      "At launch, all deposited $LAIRRY tokens are kept as the default allocation is 100% for $LAIRRY.",
      "$LAIRRY token is not live yet, but will be soon.",
      "Its positive-sum because there is always new tokens being sent to the ETF contract buy devs who are looking to get listed in the ETF.",
